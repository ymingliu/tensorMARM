Description: Multivariate additive regression for multi-view data via tensor estimation. The B-splines are used to approximate component functions. The spline coefficients are rearranged into multiple third-order tensors or even a fourth-order tensor with low-rankness under some specific conditions. Dimension reduction can be achieved by Tucker decomposition and group sparse penalty, for example, LASSO, MCP or SCAD.
